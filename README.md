## Project Overview
This project aims to provide insights into the COVID-19 pandemic using data-driven analysis. The data cleaning process ensures the accuracy of the dataset, while the Tableau visualizations help visualize trends and patterns in the data.

## Python Data Cleaning
The Python scripts in the repository handle data cleaning tasks such as handling missing values, correcting data types, and identifying outliers. These scripts ensure that the data is ready for meaningful analysis.

## Tableau Data Visualization
The Tableau Public visualizations in this project showcase the cleaned data through interactive dashboards, charts, and maps. These visualizations allow users to explore COVID-19 metrics, regional variations, and vaccination trends.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the Python scripts in the 'data-cleaning' directory for data preprocessing.
3. Access the Tableau workbooks in the 'tableau-visualizations' directory for interactive visual insights.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improvements or new features, open an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy exploring and analyzing COVID-19 data!
